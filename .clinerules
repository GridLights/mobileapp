# GridLights Mobile App - Development Instructions

## UI Verification After Changes

**IMPORTANT:** After making any UI-related changes to Vue components, always verify the changes visually:

1. **Use the browser_action tool** to launch the app at `http://localhost:8080` and visually inspect the changes
2. **Run Playwright tests** to ensure UI functionality works correctly:
   - `npm test` - Run all tests headlessly
   - `npm run test:headed` - Run tests with visible browser
   - `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Playwright UI mode
   - `npm run test:debug` - Debug tests step by step

## Development Workflow

1. Make code changes to Vue components
2. **Always check the UI** using browser_action or Playwright tests
3. Fix any visual or functional issues discovered
4. Verify the fix visually before completing the task

## Test Files Location

- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory
- Use `*.spec.js` naming convention for test files
- Configuration is in `playwright.config.js`

## Common Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with visible browser
npm run test:headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/settings.spec.js

# Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:ui
```

## Project-Specific Notes

- The app runs on `http://localhost:8080` with hash-based routing (`/#/`)
- Pages use Quasar Framework components
- Header styling is defined globally in `src/css/app.scss`
- CSS variables are defined in `:root` in `app.scss`
