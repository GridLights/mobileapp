/**
 * SOL3M BRANCH - COPILOT RULES
 *
 * PURPOSE: Temporary branch to enable demo functionality
 * Created: October 22, 2025
 *
 * CORE OBJECTIVE:
 * Make SettingsPage2.vue capture device IP and store it in localStorage.
 * Rest of app reads from localStorage and connects ONLY to real devices (no simulation).
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: SCOPE IS STRICTLY LIMITED
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This branch has ONE and ONLY ONE goal:
 * - SettingsPage2.vue: Capture device IP from user input and store in localStorage
 * - Rest of app: Read IP from localStorage and connect ONLY to real devices (never simulate)
 * - Make minimal, surgical changes to achieve this
 * - NO refactoring, NO improvements, NO feature additions, NO code cleanup
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * BRANCHING STRATEGY & FILE CHANGES
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR DEVICE CONNECTION:
 * - SettingsPage2.vue (from MAIN branch) is the integration point
 * - This file captures the device IP and stores it in localStorage
 * - The rest of the app relies on this localStorage value for all connections
 *
 * CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE:
 * - SettingsPage2.vue's ONLY job: Capture device IP → Store in localStorage
 * - All other pages/components: Read IP from localStorage → Connect ONLY to real device
 * - NO simulation, NO fake data: Only when localStorage has valid IP
 *
 * FILES TO MODIFY:
 * 1. src/pages/SettingsPage2.vue (ONLY THIS SETTINGS FILE)
 *    → Integrate IP capture logic from MAIN branch
 *    → Store IP in localStorage (key: 'ipAddress')
 *    → Add console.log() for debugging IP capture
 *    → Minimal changes, surgical integration only
 *
 * 2. src/webservices.js or device connectivity modules
 *    → ONLY if required: Read deviceIP from localStorage
 *    → ONLY if required: Check for valid IP before any connection
 *    → Do NOT make changes unless pages fail without them
 *    → Add console.log() for debugging connection attempts
 *
 * FILES TO NOT TOUCH:
 * - src/pages/SettingsPage.vue (LEAVE AS-IS - do not modify)
 * - Layouts (leave as-is unless they fail due to missing localStorage IP)
 * - Components (leave as-is unless they fail due to missing localStorage IP)
 * - Styling, effects, utils (NEVER touch)
 * - Any other code
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * REFERENCE FILES (NOT USED IN APP)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following files are created purely for functional reference and comparison.
 * They are NOT integrated into the app routing and should NOT be modified.
 *
 * IndexPageMain.vue:
 * - Copy of IndexPage.vue from MAIN branch (functional reference)
 * - Contains the working device connection logic from MAIN
 * - Has outdated UI/grid layout (not the SolSpektrum design we want)
 * - Purpose: Compare working behavior with SolSpektrum's new graphics
 * - Reason we can't use it: Uses old UI with grid containers, lacks SolSpektrum's
 *   modern design with LED Grid, sliders, effects dropdown, and bottom tab bar
 * - How to use: Reference the methods and device communication patterns
 *   when debugging IndexPage.vue functionality
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * DECISION FRAMEWORK: BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGE
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Ask yourself:
 * 1. Does this change enable the app to connect to a REAL device IP?
 * 2. Is this the MINIMUM change required to make that work?
 * 3. Does this remove dependency on fake simulation?
 * 4. Are there any other changes I want to make? → STOP. Don't do them.
 * 5. Is there a better way to do this? → Use the simpler way, not the better way.
 *
 * If ANY of these are false/no, DO NOT MAKE THE CHANGE.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHAT TO AVOID AT ALL COSTS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * - Refactoring code structure
 * - Improving variable names or code organization
 * - Updating dependencies or package versions
 * - Adding new features or pages
 * - Improving UI/UX design
 * - Fixing bugs unrelated to device connection
 * - Optimizing performance
 * - Adding comments or documentation (beyond what's necessary)
 * - Cleaning up or removing unused code
 * - Modernizing syntax or patterns
 *
 * ONLY accept changes that directly enable real device IP connection.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * REFERENCE POINTS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * WORKING VERSION: MAIN branch
 * - Device IP capture: Works correctly
 * - Device connection: Stable
 * - Demo capability: Fully functional with real devices
 *
 * CURRENT BRANCH: SolSpektrum
 * - UI/UX design: Preferred for demo
 * - Device connection: NON-FUNCTIONAL (uses fake simulation)
 *
 * SOL3M GOAL: Merge these two
 * - Keep SolSpektrum's UI/UX
 * - Replace device connection with MAIN's working logic
 * - Nothing else
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * GIT COMPARISON COMMAND
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * To see what differs between branches:
 * git diff main...SolSpektrum src/layouts/MainLayout.vue
 * git diff main...SolSpektrum src/webservices.js
 *
 * Only adopt MAIN's changes that affect device connectivity.
 * Ignore everything else.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * SUCCESS CRITERIA
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The Sol3m branch is complete when:
 * ✓ App connects to REAL device IP (not fake simulation)
 * ✓ All demo pages work with real device
 * ✓ No other code has been changed
 * ✓ No new files have been added
 * ✓ No refactoring has occurred
 * ✓ SolSpektrum's UI/UX design is preserved
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * FINAL REMINDER
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * RESIST THE URGE TO IMPROVE ANYTHING.
 *
 * This is a temporary demo branch. It will eventually be merged back or abandoned.
 * Make ONLY the bare minimum changes to enable real device connectivity.
 * Every other improvement can wait for a different branch or PR.
 *
 * Focus. Discipline. Minimal scope.
